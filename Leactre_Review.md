Q1.
Properties are called Props in short and we use them in large web pages to pass functions or componentes to another componentes in react JS. 

Q2.
The array in JS is a good example: Function is used to map from one category to another.

Q3.
Callbacks Benefit:
By Taking  setTimeout() function as an a example to  demonstrate one of the benefits of using callbacks.
The user can utilise callbacks to create a timer which runs code line by line every second.
Using this, you could write a timeout function that counts up to ten.

Callbacks Drawback:
One disadvantage of callbacks would be that they are hard to comprehend as there are plenty of functions and brackets in a relatively tiny piece of code.

Streams Benefit:
Streams are simple to grasp, so anyone with some experience may simply develop them.

Promises Benefit:
The debugging is considerably better when implementing promises especially in comparison with using callbacks

Promises Drawback:
Promises are slow comparing to callbacks  

Q4.
CSS Box Model is related to rectangular boxes formed for elements,
including padding and margin. Each box has a section for the content,
which might be photos or text. Padding, margins, and borders can then be added to this.
Padding, as used in the CSS box model, can be used to space out DOM elements.
Examples of padding would be:
padding-top \spadding-bottom \spadding-left \spadding-right
